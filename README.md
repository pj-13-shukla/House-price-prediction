# House-price-prediction


The house price prediction project in Python involves creating a model to forecast property prices. Utilizing modules like Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-Learn for model building, and Matplotlib for visualization enhances the process. Feature engineering, regression models (Linear, Lasso, Ridge), and ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) enable accurate predictions. Data preprocessing ensures optimal model performance. The system aids buyers and sellers in making informed decisions and serves as a valuable tool in real estate.
